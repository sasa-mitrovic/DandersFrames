# DandersFrames Changelog

## [4.0.8] - 2026-02-26

### Auras
* **Buff deduplication** — buffs already displayed by the Defensive Bar or Aura Designer placed indicators are automatically hidden from the buff bar. Enabled by default, toggle in Buffs tab
* **Direct Aura API mode** — optional mode that queries C_UnitAuras directly with configurable filter strings (PLAYER, RAID, BIG_DEFENSIVE, etc.), giving full control over which auras appear. Configure in Auras > Aura Filters
* **Modernized Direct API scanning** — replaced slot-by-slot GetAuraDataByIndex loops with C_UnitAuras.GetUnitAuras bulk API for better performance and reliability
* **All Buffs / All Debuffs toggles** — Direct mode now has master toggles that bypass sub-filters and pass plain HELPFUL/HARMFUL to the API. All Debuffs is on by default
* **Per-mode filter caching** — party and raid frames now build and cache separate filter strings, fixing raid frames using stale party filters
* **Multi-defensive icons** — Defensive Bar now shows all active big defensives simultaneously (up to configured max), not just one
* **Defensive bar compound growth** — growth direction now supports two-axis layouts (e.g., RIGHT_DOWN, LEFT_UP) with configurable wrap count, matching the buff/debuff icon grid system
* **Important Spells filter** — Direct mode now has an "Important Spells" checkbox for both buffs and debuffs, using the 12.0.1 IMPORTANT aura filter
* Max buff and debuff icon count increased from 5 to 8
* Direct mode filter defaults updated — All Debuffs enabled, Buffs set to My Buffs + Raid In Combat (one-time migration for existing profiles)

### Aura Designer
* **Buff coexistence** — standard buff icons can now display alongside Aura Designer indicators. When enabling AD a popup asks whether to keep or replace standard buffs, with info banners in both tabs for quick toggling
* **Health Bar Color tint mode rework** — uses a StatusBar overlay instead of color blending, fixing tint not working reliably with Blizzard's protected health values
* **Preview scale slider** — adjustable zoom (0.75×–2.5×) for the frame preview window, making it easier to place indicators on small frames like raid frames
* Aura Designer now refreshes when switching specs so per-spec aura lists update immediately

### Click Casting
* Binding tooltip moved to main Tooltip settings with full anchor and position controls
* Removed "Show Tooltips" toggle from click-cast panel (now in Tooltip settings)

### Bug Fixes
* Fix aura tooltips not showing — new parent-driven tooltip system handles all aura types (buffs, debuffs, defensives, boss debuffs, private auras)
* Fix Aura Designer indicator icons not showing tooltips on hover
* Fix Direct mode defensive icons ignoring the Icon Size slider — was reading an internal bar size (24px) instead of the user-configured setting
* Fix Direct mode debuffs not appearing on raid frames — raid frames were using stale party filter cache
* Fix dispel overlay potentially treating all debuffs as dispellable when filter constant is unavailable — hardened with RAID_PLAYER_DISPELLABLE fallback
* Fix Direct Aura API only tracking one player's auras — RegisterUnitEvent in a loop silently dropped all but the last unit
* Fix animated border flickering in Aura Designer border mode
* Fix missing raid groups when reloading UI during combat — header visibility is now set up during the ADDON_LOADED grace window
* Fix permanent buff duration text showing on non-expiring auras — native countdown text now stays as child of cooldown frame for proper auto-hiding when auras shift
* Fix debuffs being hidden when Aura Designer is enabled — debuffs now always display regardless of AD state
* Fix Health Bar Color replace mode not reverting when the aura drops off
* Fix blend slider still showing when Health Bar Color mode is set to Replace
* Fix defensive icons and aura durations showing stale data after entering/exiting vehicles — aura cache is now invalidated on vehicle swaps
* Fix unit name getting stuck to the vehicle name after exiting a vehicle
* Fix Aura Designer bar indicators getting stuck in a corrupted visual state after the tracked aura expires
* Fix boss debuff (private aura) tooltips not showing — intermediate parent frames now propagate mouse events to the unit frame
* Fix follower dungeon only showing 2-3 party members until /reload — delayed roster recheck now picks up NPCs that register late
* Fix SetUnitBuff error when hovering aura icons on recycled frames — added nil unit guard to all tooltip handlers
* Fix click-casting reload popup appearing on every login when the Clicked conflict warning is set to Ignore
* Fix Aura Designer not detecting auras hidden by Blizzard's frames (e.g., Symbiotic Relationship) — now scans units directly via C_UnitAuras API instead of reading from Blizzard's aura cache
* Fix non-defensive buffs appearing in the Defensive Bar when units are out of range — added post-validation to filter out misclassified auras
* Fix aura filter settings persisting when switching profiles — filter strings are now rebuilt on profile change
* Fix Aura Designer indicators showing wrong spells during boss fights — removed stale instanceId cache fallback, tracked auras are on Blizzard's whitelist so secret fallback is unnecessary
* Fix Aura Designer icons and squares getting stuck after auras expire — stale aura data and cooldowns are now cleared on hide, matching existing bar cleanup
* Fix Aura Designer tooltip crash when hovering indicator icons — removed legacy index-based tooltip fallback that passed invalid index=0
* Fix Aura Designer buff bar dedup not working for frame-level indicators (border, health bar color, name text) — dedup set now includes all indicator types

## [4.0.6] - 2026-02-15

### Bug Fixes
* `/df resetgui` command now works — was referencing wrong frame variable, also shows the GUI after resetting
* Settings UI can now be dragged from the bottom banner in addition to the title bar
* Fix party frame mover (blue rectangle) showing wrong size after switching between profiles with different orientations or frame dimensions
* Fix Wago UI pack imports overwriting previous profiles — importing multiple profiles sequentially no longer corrupts the first imported profile
* Fix error when duplicating a profile
