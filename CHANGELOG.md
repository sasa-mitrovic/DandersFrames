## [4.1.10] - 2026-03-31

### Bug Fixes

## [4.1.9] - 2026-03-27

### New Features

* (Boss Debuffs) **Overlay Setup Wizard** — guided setup with image previews when enabling the overlay for the first time, including a warning about visual quirks
* (Boss Debuffs) **Hide Tooltip** option — prevents the tooltip from appearing when hovering over boss debuff icons
* (Boss Debuffs) **Test Mode Overlay Preview** — preview the overlay border in test mode without needing to be in combat

### Changes

* (Flat Raids) Fix hidden groups sometimes showing frames when sorting is active
* (Flat Raids) Fix a group disappearing after roster changes during combat

### Performance
* (Aura Designer) Reduced per-event work — static properties are now set once on config change instead of every aura event

## [4.1.8] - 2026-03-26

### New Features
* (Auras) Add Aura Filter Setup Wizard — guided setup to help configure aura data source and filter options. Runs automatically on first login after update, or manually via the Aura Filters settings tab

## [4.1.7] - 2026-03-25

### Bug Fixes
* (Auras) Fix Blizzard data source showing no debuffs — Blizzard moved aura data from frame arrays to container objects in the latest update, updated reader to use new Iterate API
* (Auras) Fix dispel overlay not working in Blizzard data source — use Direct API dispel filter (IsAuraFilteredOutByInstanceID) for secret-safe dispel detection since old dispelDebuffFrames no longer populated

### Changes
* (Auras) Switch default aura data source to Direct API for all new and existing profiles — provides full control over buff/debuff filtering. Users can switch back to Blizzard mode in settings if preferred
* (Auras) Update default Direct API filters: show all debuffs, sort buffs and debuffs by time remaining

## [4.1.6] - 2026-03-25

### Bug Fixes
* (Growth) Fix nil wrap error when growth direction value has no underscore separator
* (Growth) Add safety fallback for nil wrap in growth direction composer

## [4.1.5] - 2026-03-24

### Bug Fixes
* (Grouped Raids) Fix hidden groups sometimes showing frames when players join or are moved into them — hidden group headers are now fully neutralized (attributes cleared) so they can never claim or display units
* (Boss Debuffs) Fix private auras showing on wrong players after sorting or roster changes — restore reanchor system with combat lockdown guards so anchors rebind to the correct unit token
* (Targeted Spells) Stagger icon pool creation for raid frames to prevent script-ran-too-long errors when 40 frames initialise simultaneously
* (Auras) Use SetCooldownFromDurationObject for secret-safe aura cooldowns
* (Auras) Add issecretvalue local cache to Icons.lua and DebugAuras.lua

## [4.1.4] - 2026-03-23

### New Features
* **Frame Scale** — new slider in Layout settings to scale party and raid frames (0.5x–2.0x). Movers, snap-to-grid, and drag all work correctly at any scale. Scale is per-profile and applies to containers, movers, and test frames.
* (Pinned Frames) **Auto-Update by Role** — when auto-add role filters are active (tanks, healers, DPS), players whose role no longer matches are automatically removed. Manually added players and offline players are never auto-removed.

### Bug Fixes
* (Grouped Raids) Fix empty groups overlapping populated groups — empty groups were being positioned at their natural grid slot instead of being skipped, causing overlap when groups compact
* (Grouped Raids) Fix groups sometimes overlapping on roster change — position handler now re-fires on every roster update to stay in sync with WoW's internal child re-sorting
* (Flat Raids) Fix raid anchor moving when respeccing or dying — grouped-mode positioning was resizing the shared container when flat mode was active
* (Flat Raids) Fix frames overlapping with grouped headers when auto layout switches from grouped to flat mode
* (Pinned Frames) Fix frames drifting towards bottom-left when changing scale
* (Pinned Frames) Fix drag speed mismatch at non-1.0 scale — frames now track the cursor 1:1 at any scale

## [4.1.3] - 2026-03-17

### New Features
* (Aura Designer) **Show When Missing** — per-indicator toggle that inverts visibility: shows the indicator when the aura is absent, hides when present. Supports all indicator types except bars. Icons support a "Desaturate When Missing" sub-option.
* (Aura Designer) **Show When Missing + Expiring** — when both are enabled, the indicator stays hidden while the buff is active, appears during the expiring window, then shows with normal appearance once the buff drops off
* (Auras) **Growth Direction Control** — replaced the single growth dropdown with a three-part control (Orientation, Wrap, Direction) for clearer configuration
* (Aura Designer) **Sound Alerts** — per-indicator sound alerts that play when an aura appears, expires, or is missing. Supports all LibSharedMedia sounds, adjustable volume, loop/one-shot modes, and a global "Mute All Sound Alerts" toggle in the Aura Designer banner. Includes a searchable sound dropdown picker.
* (Sorting) **[Experimental] FrameSort Addon Integration** — added support for the FrameSort addon. When enabled in General > Sorting, FrameSort controls frame ordering for party, raid (flat and grouped), and arena frames. Requires the FrameSort addon to be installed separately.

### Bug Fixes
* (Raid Frames) **Major fix** for raid frames jumping/shifting position when players join, leave, or when loading into LFR/BGs — completely reworked the reposition pipeline to batch all updates into a single authoritative reposition, with a settling debounce for instance loading
* (Flat Raid Frames) Fixed flat raid frames flickering between party and raid settings during group transitions
* (Flat Raid Frames) Fixed flat raid frame positioning breaking after layout or roster changes
* (Position) Fixed mover handles for both party and raid staying visible after switching group type
* (Auto Layouts) Fixed several issues with switching between flat and grouped layouts — duplicate frames, hidden groups reappearing after combat, and layout not updating after mid-fight settings changes
* (Aura Designer) Fixed grouped layout preview not rendering correctly after the growth direction overhaul — indicators were stacking on top of each other instead of spreading out
* (Aura Designer) Fixed custom border indicators not showing on the frame preview
* (Aura Designer) Fixed indicators appearing on disabled pinned frames
* (Aura Designer) Fixed several Show When Missing visual issues — out-of-range alpha, transparent frames, stale duration text, pulsate animation not stopping, and indicators not appearing in test mode
* (Sound Alerts) Fixed sound engine not finding raid frames when using flat layout
* (Sound Alerts) Sound-only auras now correctly tracked for buff bar dedup
* (Sorting) Fixed secret string taint in cross-realm name caching

### Improvements
* (Debug Console) Added comprehensive debug logging across roster updates, header visibility, flat raid operations, frame positioning, and frame layout — helps diagnose frame issues in the field

## [4.1.2] - 2026-03-16

### New Features
* (Health Text) **Hide % Symbol** — new checkbox to remove the percent sign from health percentage text
* (Pinned Frames) **Growth direction anchoring** — Frame Growth and Column Growth now support Start, Center, and End options, controlling which edge stays fixed as frames are added (e.g. "Start" grows rightward/downward, "End" grows leftward/upward)
* (Pinned Frames) **Reset Position button** — resets a pinned frame set to the center of the screen if it gets lost off-screen

> **Note:** Pinned frame positions may have shifted slightly due to the new anchoring system. Use the Reset Position button or reposition frames if needed.

### Bug Fixes
* (Auras) Fixed buff/debuff borders staying visible even when disabled — operator precedence bug caused the buff border check to fire regardless of aura type
* (Aura Designer) Fixed stack count text bleeding onto adjacent icons when auras reorder in a layout group
* (Defensive Icons) Fixed 2nd+ defensive bar icons always showing tooltip and ignoring tooltip settings, anchor position, and click-through configuration
* (Resource Bar) Fixed resource bar being 2px too wide when "Match Width" is enabled and a frame border is active
* (Status Icons) Fixed leader icon not hiding in combat when "Hide in Combat" is enabled
* (Pinned Frames) Fixed error when OnDragStop fires without a matching OnDragStart on pinned frame movers

## [4.1.1] - 2026-03-15

### Bug Fixes
* (Position) Lowered permanent mover frame strata from HIGH to MEDIUM so it no longer covers other UI elements
* (Defensive Icons) Fixed double-scaled positioning offsets causing defensive icons to stack vertically instead of horizontally
* (Defensive Icons) Reduced raid frame defensive icon defaults (size 20, scale 1.0, max 3) to fit narrower raid frames
* (Pinned Frames) Fixed aura designer indicators (borders, defensives, dispels) leaking onto disabled pinned frame sets
* (Aura Designer) Fixed border indicator pandemic state using the regular border alpha instead of the configured expiring alpha
* (Aura Designer) Declassified Beacon of Virtue as non-secret — spell ID 200025 is on Blizzard's whitelist and readable via standard API

## [4.1.0] - 2026-03-14

### New Features
* (Position) **Permanent Mover handle** — a small always-visible drag handle on frames for repositioning without unlocking, with customizable position, size, offset, colors, show-on-hover with fade animation, hide-in-combat option, and red combat indicator
* (Position) **Permanent Mover quick actions** — left-click, right-click, shift+left-click, and shift+right-click can be bound to 13 preset actions including open settings, quick switch profile/click-cast profile, cycle profiles, toggle test mode, unlock frames, toggle solo mode, ready check, pull timer, reset position, and reload UI
* (Position) **Permanent Mover attach to unit** — handle can be attached to the container, first visible unit, or last visible unit so it follows the group size

* (Aura Designer) **Hide duration text above threshold** — duration text can be hidden when the remaining time is above a configurable seconds threshold (icon, square, and bar types)

* (Aura Designer) **Trigger operator (ANY / ALL)** — indicators with multiple trigger spells can now require all triggers to be active (AND mode) or just one (OR mode, default)
* (Aura Designer) **Duration priority (Highest / Lowest)** — expiring indicators on multi-trigger spells can track the highest or lowest remaining duration buff
* (Aura Designer) **Custom border mode** — border indicators can now use an independent overlay per aura, so multiple border indicators can be visible at the same time
* (Aura Designer) **Settings grouped in containers** — all indicator settings panels and global defaults are now organized with bordered section containers
* (Aura Designer) **Earthliving Weapon** added as a trackable Restoration Shaman aura
* (Aura Designer) **Sense Power** added as a trackable Augmentation Evoker secret aura
* (Aura Designer) **Ebon Might self-buff tracking** — Augmentation Evoker's caster self-buff (395296) is now tracked on the player via fingerprint disambiguation, with correct tooltip and buff bar dedup
* (Aura Designer) **Symbiotic Relationship linked aura system** — Restoration Druid's caster buff is detected on the player and mirrored as an indicator onto the target's frame, with OOC target resolution, tooltip-based fallback, recast detection, and buff bar dedup

### New Features
* (Aura Designer) **Secret aura tracking** — tracks auras that WoW hides behind secret spell IDs using signature-based fingerprinting (credit to Harrek for the technique and aura data from Advanced Raid Frames)

## [4.0.8] - 2026-03-01

### New: Aura Designer
Visual indicator system for tracking buffs, debuffs, and auras on your frames.
* **8 indicator types** — 3 placed indicators (Icon, Square, Bar) that occupy anchor points on the frame, plus 5 frame effects (Border, Health Bar Color, Name Text Color, Health Text Color, Frame Alpha) that affect the entire frame
* **Drag-to-place** — drag auras from the spell list onto any of 9 anchor points (corners, edges, center) with X/Y offset adjustment
* **Icon indicators** — spell icon with cooldown swipe, duration text, and stack count display
* **Square indicators** — colored square with cooldown swipe, duration text, and stack count
* **Bar indicators** — progress bar showing remaining duration with horizontal/vertical orientation, match-frame-width option, fill color, background color, and bar-color-by-time gradient
* **Border frame effect** — 5 styles: Solid, Animated, Dashed, Glow, and Corners Only with configurable thickness and color
* **Health Bar Color frame effect** — Replace or Tint mode with adjustable blend strength
* **Name/Health Text Color frame effects** — override unit name or health text color when an aura is active
* **Frame Alpha frame effect** — adjust entire frame transparency based on aura presence
* **Expiring system** — all 8 indicator types support an expiring color that activates below a configurable remaining-duration threshold, fully combat-safe
* **Priority stacking** — configurable priority per aura (1-20); frame effects only show the highest-priority active aura, placed indicators coexist on separate anchors
* **Buff coexistence** — standard buff icons can display alongside Aura Designer indicators, with a popup to choose when enabling AD
* **Global defaults** — configure default icon size, scale, duration/stack font, font scale, and outline style; new indicators inherit these automatically with per-indicator overrides available
* **Live preview** — indicators render on the frame preview in the options panel with adjustable zoom (0.75×–2.5×)
* **Per-spec aura lists** — curated aura lists for 8 healer and augmentation specs, auto-refreshes when switching specs

### New: Auto Layouts (Raid Only)
Automatically switches your raid frame layout based on content type and raid size. Does not apply to party, solo, or arena.
* **Three content categories** — Instanced/PvP (raids, dungeons, battlegrounds), Mythic (fixed 20-player), and Open World (world bosses, outdoor groups)
* **Per-size-range profiles** — create multiple layouts per content type, each covering a custom player range (e.g., 1-10, 11-20, 21-40). Mythic is a single fixed layout for 20 players
* **Automatic switching** — monitors group roster, zone changes, and instance type; applies the matching layout on-the-fly when content or raid size changes
* **Override-only storage** — each layout stores only the settings that differ from your global profile; everything else is inherited automatically
* **Full settings coverage** — overrides can include frame size, growth direction, groups per row, group visibility, bar colors, text settings, aura filters, icon toggles, pinned frame configuration, and more
* **Live editing** — click "Edit Settings" to enter editing mode with live frame preview; every change is tracked as an override with visual indicators showing which settings are modified vs global
* **Override indicators** — green checkmark for global values, orange star with reset button for modified values, per-tab override counts
* **Non-destructive** — your global profile is never modified; exiting editing mode restores your base settings cleanly
* **Crash recovery** — if editing is interrupted, the next login detects and restores your base settings
* **Status display** — shows current content type, instance name, raid size, active layout, and override count
* **Export/import support** — auto layout configurations included in profile exports

### New: Aura System Improvements
* **Direct Aura mode** — optional mode that gives full control over which buffs and debuffs appear using filter categories (Player, Raid, Big Defensive, etc.). Configure in Auras > Aura Filters
* **All Buffs / All Debuffs toggles** — master toggles to quickly show all buffs or all debuffs without configuring individual filters
* **Important Spells filter** — checkbox to show Blizzard's curated list of important buffs and debuffs
* **Buff deduplication** — buffs already displayed by the Defensive Bar or Aura Designer are automatically hidden from the buff bar. Enabled by default, toggle in Buffs tab
* **Multi-defensive icons** — Defensive Bar now shows all active big defensives simultaneously (up to configured max), not just one
* **Defensive bar compound growth** — growth direction now supports two-axis layouts (e.g., RIGHT_DOWN, LEFT_UP) with configurable wrap count
* Max buff and debuff icon count increased from 5 to 8

### New Features
