## [4.0.12] - 2026-03-06

### New Features
* **Multi-trigger frame effects** (Aura Designer) — a single frame effect (border, health bar color, etc.) can now trigger on any of multiple auras (e.g. show a border if Rejuvenation OR Regrowth OR Lifebloom is active)
* **Layout groups** (Aura Designer) — group placed indicators at a shared anchor with automatic flow positioning; when an aura is inactive, grouped indicators collapse without gaps
* **Spec-scoped aura configs** (Aura Designer) — configurations are now saved per-spec, so shared buffs like Prayer of Mending can have different indicator setups on each spec
* **Preview click-to-select** (Aura Designer) — left-click any indicator on the frame preview to jump to its settings; right-click to remove it
* **Duration and Stack text color** (Aura Designer) — new color pickers with alpha for duration text and stack text on icon and square indicators, available as both global defaults and per-indicator overrides
* **Hide Icon (Text Only)** (Aura Designer) — new checkbox on icon and square indicators that hides the icon visual while keeping duration and stack text visible
* **Cancel Targeting option** (Click Casting) — new per-binding checkbox in advanced settings that adds /stopspelltarget to the macro, preventing the blue targeting hand on certain spells. Disabled by default so spells like Rescue work correctly

* (Frames) Fixed aura icons created during combat permanently losing tooltip hover after combat ends

## [4.0.10] - 2026-03-02

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed addon managers (Wago, CurseForge) constantly prompting for updates due to stale version in TOC file — version is now updated as part of every release
* Fixed Aura Designer tracking buffs from other players instead of only your own casts

### New Features
* **Auto layout Copy To** — duplicate an auto layout (with all overrides) to any content type section, including same-section copying for different size ranges
* **Only My Buffs filter** — new toggle in Direct API buff filters that restricts all buff filters to player-cast buffs only (enabled by default); removes the now-redundant My Buffs sub-filter

## [4.0.9] - 2026-03-02

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed imported and duplicated profiles resetting to Default on reload/relog due to per-character SavedVariable not being synced

### New Features
* **Direct API buff filters** — added Not Cancelable, Big Defensives, and External Defensives as toggleable filter options
* **Additive filter logic** — enabled filters now use OR logic so selecting multiple categories shows the union (e.g. Raid In Combat + Big Defensives shows both) instead of requiring auras to match all selected filters
* **Defensive icon scanning** — defensive icon now detects both Big Defensives and External Defensives (e.g. Pain Suppression, Blessing of Sacrifice)
* **Filter tooltips** — hover any filter checkbox to see a description of what that category includes
* **Defensive bar spacing** — icon spacing slider now supports negative values for overlapping icons
* **Updated filter defaults** — buff filters default to Raid In Combat + Big Defensives + External Defensives; debuff filters default to Raid Debuffs + Crowd Control + Important Spells (migrated for existing users)

## [4.0.8] - 2026-03-01

### New: Aura Designer
Visual indicator system for tracking buffs, debuffs, and auras on your frames.
* **8 indicator types** — 3 placed indicators (Icon, Square, Bar) that occupy anchor points on the frame, plus 5 frame effects (Border, Health Bar Color, Name Text Color, Health Text Color, Frame Alpha) that affect the entire frame
* **Drag-to-place** — drag auras from the spell list onto any of 9 anchor points (corners, edges, center) with X/Y offset adjustment
* **Icon indicators** — spell icon with cooldown swipe, duration text, and stack count display
* **Square indicators** — colored square with cooldown swipe, duration text, and stack count
* **Bar indicators** — progress bar showing remaining duration with horizontal/vertical orientation, match-frame-width option, fill color, background color, and bar-color-by-time gradient
* **Border frame effect** — 5 styles: Solid, Animated, Dashed, Glow, and Corners Only with configurable thickness and color
* **Health Bar Color frame effect** — Replace or Tint mode with adjustable blend strength
* **Name/Health Text Color frame effects** — override unit name or health text color when an aura is active
* **Frame Alpha frame effect** — adjust entire frame transparency based on aura presence
* **Expiring system** — all 8 indicator types support an expiring color that activates below a configurable remaining-duration threshold, fully combat-safe
* **Priority stacking** — configurable priority per aura (1-20); frame effects only show the highest-priority active aura, placed indicators coexist on separate anchors
* **Buff coexistence** — standard buff icons can display alongside Aura Designer indicators, with a popup to choose when enabling AD
* **Global defaults** — configure default icon size, scale, duration/stack font, font scale, and outline style; new indicators inherit these automatically with per-indicator overrides available
* **Live preview** — indicators render on the frame preview in the options panel with adjustable zoom (0.75×–2.5×)
* **Per-spec aura lists** — curated aura lists for 8 healer and augmentation specs, auto-refreshes when switching specs

### New: Auto Layouts (Raid Only)
Automatically switches your raid frame layout based on content type and raid size. Does not apply to party, solo, or arena.
* **Three content categories** — Instanced/PvP (raids, dungeons, battlegrounds), Mythic (fixed 20-player), and Open World (world bosses, outdoor groups)
* **Per-size-range profiles** — create multiple layouts per content type, each covering a custom player range (e.g., 1-10, 11-20, 21-40). Mythic is a single fixed layout for 20 players
* **Automatic switching** — monitors group roster, zone changes, and instance type; applies the matching layout on-the-fly when content or raid size changes
* **Override-only storage** — each layout stores only the settings that differ from your global profile; everything else is inherited automatically
* **Full settings coverage** — overrides can include frame size, growth direction, groups per row, group visibility, bar colors, text settings, aura filters, icon toggles, pinned frame configuration, and more
* **Live editing** — click "Edit Settings" to enter editing mode with live frame preview; every change is tracked as an override with visual indicators showing which settings are modified vs global
* **Override indicators** — green checkmark for global values, orange star with reset button for modified values, per-tab override counts
* **Non-destructive** — your global profile is never modified; exiting editing mode restores your base settings cleanly
* **Crash recovery** — if editing is interrupted, the next login detects and restores your base settings
* **Status display** — shows current content type, instance name, raid size, active layout, and override count
* **Export/import support** — auto layout configurations included in profile exports

### New: Aura System Improvements
* **Direct Aura mode** — optional mode that gives full control over which buffs and debuffs appear using filter categories (Player, Raid, Big Defensive, etc.). Configure in Auras > Aura Filters
* **All Buffs / All Debuffs toggles** — master toggles to quickly show all buffs or all debuffs without configuring individual filters
* **Important Spells filter** — checkbox to show Blizzard's curated list of important buffs and debuffs
* **Buff deduplication** — buffs already displayed by the Defensive Bar or Aura Designer are automatically hidden from the buff bar. Enabled by default, toggle in Buffs tab
* **Multi-defensive icons** — Defensive Bar now shows all active big defensives simultaneously (up to configured max), not just one
* **Defensive bar compound growth** — growth direction now supports two-axis layouts (e.g., RIGHT_DOWN, LEFT_UP) with configurable wrap count
* Max buff and debuff icon count increased from 5 to 8

### New Features
* Health fade system — fades frames above a configurable health threshold, with option to cancel fade when a dispellable debuff is active (contributed by X-Steeve)
